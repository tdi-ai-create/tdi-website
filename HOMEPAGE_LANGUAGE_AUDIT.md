# TDI Homepage Language Audit: Teacher vs Admin Focus

## Executive Summary

| Category | Count | Percentage |
|----------|-------|------------|
| **Teacher-Focused** | 18 | 45% |
| **Admin-Focused** | 8 | 20% |
| **Neutral/Both** | 14 | 35% |

**Overall Assessment**: The homepage skews **heavily toward teacher language** (45% teacher vs 20% admin). While this aligns with the brand origin story, it may undersell TDI to school/district decision-makers who control PD budgets.

## Missing Admin Keywords

| Keyword | Current Usage | Recommendation |
|---------|---------------|----------------|

| Implementation rate | In calculator only | Add to main copy |
| Budget efficiency | 0 times | Add to funding mentions |
| Compliance / State standards | 0 times | Consider adding |

| Scalable | 0 times | Add for district buyers |
| District-wide | 0 times | Add for large buyers |
| Title I / Title II / ESSER | 0 times | Add to funding section |
| Evidence-based (ESSA tiers) | 0 times | Add for compliance buyers |

---

## Recommendations

### Quick Wins (No structural changes)

1. **Hero subhead**: Change "Educator-Focused" to "Educator-Focused. Admin-Approved."

2. **Stats bar**: Add an admin-focused stat like:
 - "65% avg implementation rate" (vs industry 10%)
 - "80% secure external funding"

3. **"How We Build" heading**: Consider "How We Build What Educators Need" (inclusive)

4. **Final CTA headline**: Change to "Ready to Reimagine PD?" (appeals to both)

### Medium Effort

5. **Add admin testimonial to top**: Move Michelle M. or James T. testimonial higher on page

6. **Calculator section intro**: Add "See your potential ROI" language

7. **Problem section**: Add a sentence about admin pain: "...And leaders waste budgets on PD that sits on a shelf."

### Consider For Future

8. **Dedicated admin hero variant**: A/B test a hero with admin-focused headline for paid traffic

9. **Add "Results" section**: Stats about implementation rates, satisfaction scores, retention data

---

## Conclusion

The homepage effectively speaks to teachers (TDI's origin and community), but may miss opportunities to convert school/district decision-makers who:
- Control PD budgets
- Need ROI justification
- Care about implementation metrics
- Want compliance/evidence-based solutions

The "Two Ways to Work With Us" section is well-balanced, but by that point, admin visitors have scrolled through 4 teacher-focused sections. Consider front-loading more dual-audience messaging.
